# TEA JAM - Timeline & Checklist (14-Day Plan)

Keep your project manageable we must break the 14 days into clear phases. Below is a day-by-day (or phase-by-phase) checklist from brainstorming to final submission. Feel free to adjust based on your schedules, but try to sequence tasks in this logical order:

**Day 1: Kickoff and Brainstorm**  
- [x] **Team Meeting:** Discuss the jam’s theme (if any) and initial ideas. Sit together (in person or via call) and list what kind of supplement or adventure you both find exciting. Encourage wild ideas – no judgments at this stage.  
- [x] **Scope and Goals:** Decide on a *rough concept* by the end of Day 1. For example, will you make a short adventure module, a collection of items, a new character archetype, or a region guide? Pick something that fits TEA’s world and is achievable in two weeks. Keep the scope small and focused. One strong location or a 4-5 page adventure is better than an overly ambitious project that you can’t finish.  
- [x] **Roles:** 
Elizabeth Artist

Malcolm Dev

Clarify each person’s role. Typically, the **artist** will create illustrations or graphical elements, and the **developer** will handle writing, coding, and layout. But both can contribute to brainstorming and writing. Set expectations that you’ll review each other’s work and collaborate on the narrative and design.

**Day 2: Planning and Setup**  
- [x] **Project Setup:** The developer sets up a repository on GitHub (or your preferred version control platform). Initialize it with a basic README and appropriate structure (e.g., folders for `art/`, `docs/` or `src/`, etc.). This is also a good time to create a blank HTML page or a simple site structure if you plan a web presentation.  
- [x] **Tool Access:** Ensure both team members have access to necessary tools. For art, set up a **Magma** canvas (invite the developer too if they need to see or comment). For code, make sure the artist can access the GitHub repo if they need to add files (or use a shared cloud folder for large art files if not putting them in Git).  
- [ ] **Brainstorm Details:** Refine the concept from Day 1. Create an outline or list of content needed. For example: *“We need a backstory for the adventure, 3 NPC descriptions, a dungeon map, 2 illustrations (one cover image and one monster), and some rules for a collapsing temple mechanic to fit the theme.”* Having this list will drive your tasks.  
- [x] **Issue Tracking:** Create tasks for each item in your outline using a project board or issue tracker. For example, make an issue for “Write adventure outline”, “Sketch map of temple”, “Code HTML structure”, etc. (We’ll discuss tools in Section 5, but you can set this up now).



**Days 3-4: Writing and Sketching**  
- [ ] **Write a Draft:** The developer (and possibly the artist, if they want to write) begins drafting the text of the supplement. Start with an outline and then fill in sections. Don’t worry about it being perfect – just get the ideas down. Aim to complete a rough draft of all textual content by the end of Day 4. This could be done in a simple Markdown file or directly in HTML, or even a Google Doc – whatever is comfortable, because you’ll revise it later.  
- [ ] **Sketch Concepts:** Meanwhile, the artist begins sketching early visual concepts. Focus on *visual storytelling* – what images will best convey the theme and make the content exciting? Perhaps sketch the main location or a key character. At this stage, rough sketches are fine. It’s more important to plan *what* you will illustrate (and how it supports the text) than to have final art. Discuss with the writer: which parts of the story or supplement would benefit most from an illustration or diagram? For example, if the adventure is about a collapsing temple, a sketch of the temple or the collapse mechanism could be very helpful for players/GMs.  
- [ ] **Concept Approval:** Share the draft text and concept sketches with each other. Make sure both team members agree on the direction. This prevents misalignment (like art depicting something different than the text describes). If something doesn’t fit or feels too large to do, adjust now before investing more time. Keep communication open and positive, finding solutions together if there are any concerns.

**Days 5-7: Production – Art and Content Creation**  
- [ ] **Art Creation:** The artist works on turning sketches into final line art or digital paintings using Magma. Set aside dedicated time to draw in the shared canvas. Use separate layers for different elements (e.g., one layer for sketch, one for inks/lineart, one for colors) to allow flexibility and prevent accidents. Magma supports up to 100 layers with standard blending modes, which is plenty for a complex illustration ([Magma.com - The ultimate free tool for drawing online with friends](https://drawyourweapon.com/drawing-online-with-friends-magma-studio/#:~:text=,Standard%20layer%20blending%20modes)). Take advantage of these layers to organize your work (for example, keep characters on one layer and background on another). If anxiety arises while drawing (common for many artists), remember that it’s a collaborative project: share work-in-progress with your teammate. Their feedback can reassure you that you’re on the right track or help redirect if needed. Keep reminding yourself that rough spots can be refined later – focus on getting the idea across first.  
- [ ] **Writing and Rules Refinement:** The developer expands and refines the written content. Flesh out any sections that were left skeletal in the draft. At the same time, start thinking about how this content will be presented. If it’s a web page, consider if each section will be on a separate page or one long scrolling page. If it’s a PDF, think about page count and layout (maybe sketch a quick layout on paper). Ensure that the content aligns with TEA’s tone and rules – it’s good to double-check the free TEA rules reference if you’re adding any mechanics. Aim to finish a solid **second draft** by Day 7.  
- [ ] **First Integration Point:** By the end of Day 7 (the first week), try to have a “mid-jam checkpoint.” This could be a very rough website or document that includes the draft text and perhaps placeholder images (or the sketches). For example, the developer can push the text into an HTML page with basic formatting, and include the sketch images as placeholders. This integration is important: it lets you see how text and art work together. It’s easier to adjust content or layout now than at the last minute. Review it together and note any changes needed (maybe the text is too long for the planned format, or the art needs to be a different size or aspect ratio).

**Days 8-10: Development and Collaboration**  
- [ ] **Web Development:** The developer focuses on the technical implementation now. If you’re building a website for the project, set up the styling and interactive elements during this period. Create a simple, clean design that fits the aesthetic (perhaps a bit archaic or sci-fantasy to match TEA’s feel). Ensure readability: choose an easy-to-read font (and consider dyslexia-friendly fonts or options, as the developer or even some users might benefit from them ([Programming as a dyslexic | Learning Pool](https://learningpool.com/en-us/blog/programming-as-a-dyslexic/#:~:text=I%20do%20also%20have%20some,I%20would%20love%20to%20share))). Implement responsive design so it looks good on mobile if possible. Start deploying to a test URL (using GitHub Pages or Netlify – details in Section 3) so you can see it live.  
- [ ] **Version Control Checkpoint:** Commit your code frequently to GitHub. After major milestones (like “basic layout done” or “added responsive CSS”), push those commits. Use meaningful commit messages to document progress – for example, `Add basic HTML structure and navigation` or `Style content sections with CSS`. Good commit messages explain what changed and *why*, which helps later when reviewing history ([Git Explained: Proper Team Etiquette - DEV Community](https://dev.to/milu_franz/git-explained-proper-team-etiquette-1od#:~:text=Good%20commit%20messages%20matter%20because,to%20compose%20precise%20commit%20messages)). Keeping commits small and focused (one logical change per commit) is a good habit ([Git Explained: Proper Team Etiquette - DEV Community](https://dev.to/milu_franz/git-explained-proper-team-etiquette-1od#:~:text=A%20commit%20should%20consist%20of,that%20could%20help%20you%20out)). This makes it easier to trace issues and rollback if needed.  
- [ ] **Art Refinement:** The artist continues polishing the artwork. By now, you might have one or two key pieces in progress. Add detail and clean up line work. If using color, establish a color scheme that complements the story (for instance, if the theme is “Collapse” in a dusty temple, maybe a muted palette of browns and grays with a splash of eerie green for magical elements). While refining, keep checking that the art supports the text. Ask: does this image help a Game Master imagine the scenario or item? Does it evoke the right mood? If not, tweak it or discuss changes. The artist can also create small decorative elements if time permits (like icons, borders, or maps) – but only if the main pieces are done and there’s extra time.  
- [ ] **Team Sync:** Around Day 10, have another check-in. The developer can show the live or local version of the site/PDF with updated content, and the artist can show nearly completed art. Make sure everything still fits together. At this point, identify any **gaps or risks**: Is any crucial part missing? Is there a section of text waiting on art or vice versa? Prioritize finishing those in the next days. Also, begin thinking about how to present the final submission on itch.io (you might need a cover image – perhaps one of the artworks can serve as the cover).

**Days 11-12: Polishing and Finalizing**  
- [ ] **Content Polish:** Now shift into polishing mode. The writer/developer should proofread all text for clarity and typos. Since the developer has dyslexia, use supportive strategies: for example, use a spell-checker tool or extension (VS Code has plugins, or copy the text into a word processor for spell-check). Taking a short break and then re-reading can help catch mistakes that were initially overlooked ([Ask HN: Programming and dyslexia | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30135651#:~:text=Sometimes%20I%27ll%20write%20something%20out,by%20then%20it%27s%20too%20late)). Reading the text aloud (or using text-to-speech) is another great way to spot awkward phrasing or missing words. Ensure the tone is consistent and the instructions or descriptions make sense. If available, ask a friend or one of the Discord community members to read through it once – fresh eyes catch things you might miss.  
- [ ] **Accessibility Review:** The developer should also do an accessibility check on the website (if that’s the format). Make sure images have **alt text** describing them (so that people using screen readers or who can’t load images know what’s shown). Check that text is readable: sufficiently large font size, good color contrast (e.g., no light grey text on white or similar low-contrast combinations). This is important for users and also beneficial given the developer’s perspective on readability. If you’ve chosen any fancy decorative font, consider limiting it to titles and use a simple font for body text to help dyslexic readers.  
- [ ] **Optimize Assets:** Finalize and export all art assets. In Magma, once an illustration is complete, use the *Export* function to download a high-quality PNG (or PSD if you need to do post-processing in another software) ([PSD File Sync | Magma Help Center](https://help.magma.com/en/articles/6746418-psd-file-sync#:~:text=In%20that%20case%2C%20you%20can,open%20locally%20on%20your%20computer)). Double-check the resolution – if it’s intended for print (like in a PDF), 300 DPI is ideal. If it’s only for web, ensure the dimensions in pixels are adequate for on-screen viewing. You might have to export a large version and then resize or compress it. Use an image optimization tool (like TinyPNG or an online compressor) to reduce file size without visible quality loss, which will make your website load faster.  
- [ ] **Integration of Art and Text:** Insert the final art into the project. If it’s a website, replace placeholder images with the final PNGs and adjust the layout or styling if needed to accommodate them (for example, ensure the image is scaled correctly and captions are added if appropriate). If it’s a PDF or document, place the images in the layout at this stage. Pay attention to how text flows around images or how pages break. This is the time to make small layout tweaks for a professional finish – such as spacing, fonts, and alignment.  
- [ ] **Final Feature Checks:** Make sure all planned features are implemented. For instance, if you intended to include a simple interactive element on the website (maybe a dice roller or a dynamic map), ensure it’s working and tested. However, avoid last-minute risky changes. Stick mostly to polishing what’s there, rather than adding new content on Day 12. If you realize something is missing that is *essential* (say, a section of text or a label on the map), add it now. But if an idea is “nice-to-have” but not done yet, it may be safer to cut it to avoid rushing and causing bugs or low-quality results.

**Day 13: Testing & Buffer**  
- [ ] **Full Test Run:** Treat Day 13 as a buffer for thorough testing. Navigate through the entire website or PDF as if you were a user or reader. If it’s a game supplement, imagine you are a Game Master trying to use it: is everything clear and easy to find? On the website, test all links, buttons, or navigation. Ensure it works on different devices/browsers if possible (at least check on a phone vs. a laptop). For a PDF, test opening it on different readers, and even printing a page if applicable, to ensure it prints correctly.  
- [ ] **Proofreading:** Do a final proofread after testing, because sometimes when fixing one thing, a typo or error might slip in elsewhere. It can help to change the presentation when proofreading (for example, zoom in or out, or change the background color) to see the text with fresh eyes ([Ask HN: Programming and dyslexia | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30135651#:~:text=My%20trick%20is%20that%20when,window%20to%20reflow%20the%20text)). Small grammar or spelling issues can be corrected now.  
- [ ] **Feedback:** If you can, have someone not on the team quickly review the almost-final product on Day 13. A quick outside opinion can validate that your work is understandable to others. The TEA Discord might have willing folks to look over it. If they point out any confusion or minor mistakes, you still have time to fix them.  
- [ ] **Submission Prep:** Gather everything needed for submission. Typically, itch.io jams require uploading your files or providing a link. Decide how you will submit: **if it’s a webpage,** you might upload a small file on itch that just points people to the external site (or use itch’s *“external URL”* option to link to your live site). You might also prepare a PDF version to upload, because many players/judges like a downloadable copy. **If it’s a PDF/zine primarily,** just ensure the PDF is final and ready to upload. Also prepare an attractive cover image and screenshots for the itch.io submission page to showcase your work.

**Day 14: Final Polish and Submission**  
- [ ] **Last-minute Touches:** Do a quick run-through in the morning of deadline day for any tiny tweaks. At this point, avoid making any big changes or adding new features – there’s no time for extensive re-testing. Instead, focus on presentation: update your itch.io project page with a clear description, credits, and the required license text. Double-check that the TEA Third Party License text is included *inside* your project (for example, on the credits page or an “About” section) as required ([The Electrum Archive](https://www.electrumarchive.com/#license#:~:text=The%20following%20text%20must%20be,where%20you%20promote%20the%20product)). Also include the line acknowledging TEA’s copyright owners as specified by the license ([The Electrum Archive](https://www.electrumarchive.com/#license#:~:text=This%20copyright%20text%20must%20be,included%20somewhere%20on%20the%20product)). This is an important detail for compliance.  
- [ ] **Upload/Deploy:** If you have a PDF or ZIP, upload it to the itch.io jam page. If your project is a website, ensure it is deployed and live (e.g., on GitHub Pages or Netlify) and then either upload a small “placeholder” file that contains the link or use the provided field for an external URL. Make sure the version you have online is the final one. It’s a good idea to freeze new commits at this point to avoid deploying something broken accidentally right before judging.  
- [ ] **Submit to Jam:** Go to the jam page and submit your project. Fill in all required fields (title, description, etc.). Write a short and inviting description of your project. For example: *“Collapsed Temple of Ilsaar – A one-shot adventure for The Electrum Archive. Explore an ancient temple on the verge of collapse, with unique mechanisms and lore from the world of Orn. Includes a printable map and original artwork.”* Mention that it’s for TEA and if you used the jam’s theme, highlight how (jam organizers and voters like to see the connection).  
- [ ] **Celebrate and Share:** Congratulations, you’ve submitted! Take a moment to celebrate with your teammate. Even if it’s just a virtual high-five, acknowledging this achievement is important. After submission, you can promote your work: share the itch.io link on social media, Discord, or relevant communities. For example, you might post on Twitter with the jam hashtag or in the TEA Discord’s showcase channel. Share a cool screenshot or a snippet of art to attract interest. (Marketing is optional but can be motivating – it’s fun to see people download or comment on your creation.)  
- [ ] **Post-Jam** (Optional): Once the jam deadline has passed, avoid the temptation to fix things immediately during the rating period (if there is one). However, you can note down any improvements you want for later. If the jam allows updates, you could release a post-jam version after judging. But for now, pat yourselves on the back and enjoy looking at what others made too. You did it in 14 days!
